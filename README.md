# Cloud-based Public Transit System

A simple and easy-to-use website that allows users to create an account, login and easily purchase tickets. 
This is a cloud-based web application that serves to promote the idea of creating a simple web site.

While this does not perform a full generic site with payment features, it does promote the idea of developing an easy way to purchase bus tickets online.

Once user(s) log-in, they can click a button to whichever ticket they wish to purchase. Upon so, they will recieve a confirmation email with their name and ticket they purchased. The email will be saved during account registration, so users will not need to forget which email they provided. It is all saved within a secure Amazon RDS.

An added feature is a google maps which serves to show the user all the bus stations in the Durham region. The API key was used to utilize Gogle Maps, and GeoJSON for the data extraction is specific to the Durham region (as this was the only one that was public and free to use).
